REQUIREMENTS
============

- NSIS 2.46 or higher (http://nsis.sourceforge.net))
- Services plugin (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Services_plug-in)
- KillProcDLL plug-in (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/KillProcDLL_plug-in)
- SetACL 2.0.3 or higher (http://setacl.sourceforge.net/)
- NSIS Simple Firewall Plugin 1.19 or higher (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Simple_Firewall_Plugin)
- ShellExecAsUser plugin (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/ShellExecAsUser_plug-in)

Put SetACL.exe into OCS-NG_Windows_Agent_Setup.nsi script directory, and 
compile OCS-NG_Windows_Agent_Setup.nsi (Script assume that agent's binary
are on directory "../release", and that MS VC++ 2008 is installed into
default folder "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC").

It's quite difficult to build libcurl for target Windows 2000 using MS Visual
C++ 2008 or higher. It needs to modify code and Microsoft Windows SDK 6.X,
shipped with Visual Studio 2008, does not mention Windows 2000 as a valid build
target, only Windows XP and higher.  

So, for Windows 2000 target only, we prefer using a precompiled binary distribution
from Gï¿½nter Knauf, built using MingW32 compiler, and available at location
http://www.gknw.net/mirror/curl/win32/curl-7.21.3-ssl-sspi-zlib-static-bin-w32.zip
Just download this package and unzip it into nsis_agent_setup folder.

MS11-025 critical fix introduces incompatibilty problem of MS CRT/MFC 9.0 with
Windows 2000 (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/04/26/10158277.aspx).
So for Windows 2000 only, we have chosen to install original MS CRT/MFC
9.00.21022.8 provided with Visual C++ 2008 without Service Pack or hot fixes.
You must put these files into "vc2008_redist_9.00.21022.8_for_Windows_2000"
sub directory before building NSIS installer.
